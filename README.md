Hi this is MemeOverload from Overload lnc.
This is my first PyGame project. Hope you enjoy it.

I used PyGame for this project. To convert it into an executable file I used PyInstaller and if you ever used it you might know that sometimes files convert by PyInstaller get tagged with a False Positive Virus Scan which means your antivirus program think's that a file that isn't virus is a virus. If you don't have a problem with that you can go ahead and download the .exe file but if you want to be sure that it doesn't contain a virus or you want to mess with the code you can download the .py source code.
Anyway hope you enjoy it.
